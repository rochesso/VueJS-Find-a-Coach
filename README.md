# find-a-coach

"Find a Coach" is a project that I developed in conjunction with an advanced Vue.js course. This application offers a robust set of features that enable users to create an account, log in, and register as a coach. Registered coaches can receive requests from users seeking their services, which are viewable when logged in.
